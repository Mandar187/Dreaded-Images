## 🕹️ About the Game

**DREADED IMAGES** is a terrifying first-person horror experience set in the liminal nightmare of the Backrooms.  
Your mission: **Collect 8 cursed images** scattered randomly throughout an infinite maze of yellow walls, flickering lights, and dread.

But you're not alone.

**Two unrelenting monsters** and **one unpredictable zombie** roam the halls. Each one moves, reacts, and hunts differently.  
Every image you collect draws them closer — and your flashlight might be your only warning.
